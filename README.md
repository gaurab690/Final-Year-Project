# Final-Year-Project
This is my Final Year Project: an e-commerce platform for cosmetic products built using Laravel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes user authentication, product management, shopping cart, and payment integration. The project focuses on providing customers and admins with a smooth and user-friendly experience.
