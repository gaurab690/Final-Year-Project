# Final-Year-Project
This is my Final Year Project: an e-commerce platform for cosmetic products built using Laravel, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes user authentication, product management, shopping cart, and payment integration. The project focuses on providing a smooth and user-friendly experience for customers and admins.
